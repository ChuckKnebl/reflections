For Learning to Use GitHub

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

CK:  You would be able to learn from your mistake-prone early versions.

If you were to put "git diff" on the map, which of the following existing concept(s) would you directly connect it with?
commit
Google Docs
git  
Version Control

CK: commit

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git,
 vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

CK:  Pros would be that you can decide to create a commit when a change follows logic to fix one problem.  Also, a con of automatic saving 
would be too clutered to easily see your mistakes and changes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

CK:  Because creating a snapshot of every file in your repository when you save with a commit will help your organization and tracking of changes.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

CK:  I can use these commands by accessing the "git log," hitting Q to exit the log, then using the correct
"git diff" command, and copying and pasting the correct IDs from the log.  Then I will be able to see and analyze
the changes that have been made to code.
